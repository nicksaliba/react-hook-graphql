# Template: Simple GraphQL Server

This template contains a folder with a very basic implementation of a GraphQL server (with Apollo).

## Adding a frontend

One very easy way to add a React JS frontend application is to use create-react-app:
```
npx create-react-app frontend
```

The resulting structure will then look something like this:
```
|
|- api
|- frontend
|- README.md
```

### Run it

To run the application locally, you have to start both server and frontend application:
1. Navigate to the `api` folder in the terminal and start the server: `npm run start`
2. (Open `localhost:4000` in the browser to test the GraphQL API)
2. In a different terminal navigate to the `frontend` folder (or however you called it) and run it as well.
3. Open `localhost:3000 in a browser to see the frontend application.
